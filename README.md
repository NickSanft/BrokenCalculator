# Broken Calculator

Welcome to the Broken Calculator, a unique calculator app where you have to unlock the basic arithmetic operations before you can use them! This project is built entirely with Jetpack Compose and follows modern Android development practices.

## Features

*   **Adaptive UI:** The layout automatically adjusts for both portrait and landscape orientations, providing a seamless user experience.
*   **Dark Theme:** The app defaults to a sleek, modern dark theme.
*   **Unlockable Operations:** Subtraction, multiplication, and division are initially disabled. You have to perform specific calculations to unlock them, adding a fun puzzle element to the app.
*   **Hints System:** If you get stuck, a hints dialog is available to guide you on how to unlock each operation.
*   **Reset Functionality:** You can reset the calculator at any time to re-lock all the operations and start the challenge over.

## Unlocking Operations (Cheat Codes)

Here are the secret codes to unlock the calculator's operations:

*   **Subtraction (-):** `2+2`
*   **Division (/):** `5-1` (after unlocking subtraction)
*   **Multiplication (*):** Attempt to divide by zero (e.g., `1/0`)

## Building and Running the Project

To build and run the project, you'll need Android Studio. Once you have it set up, you can clone the repository and open it in Android Studio. The project should build and run without any additional configuration.
